###### Milestone project 3: Backend Development – Code Institute

The project is made for general audience to use for expressing ones ideas, searching for inspiration 
for personal projects or just for a painting subject matter. It is mostly based on user input 
and customer experience where everybody can participate or come in a search of motivation.

###### UX

The site is made simple and user friendly as it has a primitive function 
of connecting people and their ideas and making them inspired for collaborations or expressing themselves.

###### User Stories

1.As a customer of this platform, I come to write down my own ideas and search for ideas 
whenever I feel empty or unmotivated. This site is a source of inspiration for me, 
and sometimes one has to read about ideas to start creating own.

2.I like the idea of a website where you can actually write down something that is on your mind, 
sometimes it takes only naming it so you can envision it.

###### Strategy

The goal of a simple design is to make users concentrate on their ideas 
and to make the navigation through the platform really simple and even primitive. 

###### Scope

The site is structured to easily navigate the world of art as well as find particular subject one searches for.

###### Structure

The site structure is based on ergonomics, so it is to take the customer to the information 
one’s searching without having to scroll through any unnecessary documents, 
reading texts that are advertising or filing the forms that appear to be unnecessary. 

###### Sceleton

Using these wireframes were created to support the idea of a site.

###### Surface

The colour palette was chosen on Pinterest platform to benefit a simple design of the project.

###### Technologies

HTML – to create the foundation of a site.
CSS – to create visually pleasant web page.
JavaScript – to make it more interactive.
MongoDB – for data 
Python 
Materialize – to make it responsive.
Axure – to create sketches of a future site.
JQuery - to simplify DOM manipulation

###### Features

The existing features let the user to register on the site and use the features that other users can only read.
1. User that does not want to register can read the ideas, but thats all, 
2. User register and can use features that let them add categories or ideas or edit them or remove them.

###### Features left to implement

The features that can be added in a future are: 
1. The possibility of a private messages between members, 
2. The possibility to upload sketches or images, 
3. The possibility to upload examples of used ideas, 
4. The possibility to rate the ideas.

###### Testing

1. The register form and route is working, the only issue is that it does not recognize the same user,
so many users with the same name and password can register.
2. Sign in form was not working at all, but it was only white space and python blank lines that neede fixing.
3. Users can create a new idea but only the idea the particular user creates can be edited or deleted by that 
particular user.
4. Manage categories is also secured feature so only somebody who is laura can see the feature.
5. Users can easily sign out, but they still will be able to read the ideas.
6. everytime user is editing or adding something the flash messages appear to inform that the move was successful.
7. I opened and tested this app with different browsers, such as Microsoft edge, chrome, firefox.
Opened and tested features with different gadgets such as laptop, tablet, different phone models.

###### Deployment

This project was deployed to heroku as showed on the course and 
I am lucky as there were no issues with deploying the whole project as well as adding different prts to it.
Css features seem to come later though.

###### Content

The idea of the project and most of a code is taken from code institute mini project, 
but I changed the purpose of the app.
I hope I added a different perspective on how the mini project can be used.
I also tried to make it look a bit different, but still need a deeper knowledge of python and coding in general.
The quote is by David Lynch taken from internet in a hope to inspire users to write one.

###### Aknowledgment

I appreacite very much the help of Tim Nielsen and Aaron Sinnott for this project,
