###### Milestone project 3: Backend Development – Code Institute

The project is made for general audience to use for expressing ones ideas, searching for inspiration 
for personal projects or just for a painting subject matter. It is mostly based on user input 
and customer experience where everybody can participate or come in a search of motivation.

###### UX

The site is made simple and user friendly as it has a primitive function 
of connecting people and their ideas and making them inspired for collaborations or expressing themselves.

###### User Stories

1.As a customer of this platform, I come to write down my own ideas and search for ideas 
whenever I feel empty or unmotivated. This site is a source of inspiration for me, 
and sometimes one has to read about ideas to start creating own.

2.I like the idea of a website where you can actually write down something that is on your mind, 
sometimes it takes only naming it so you can envision it.

###### Strategy

The goal of a simple design is to make users concentrate on their ideas 
and to make the navigation through the platform really simple and even primitive. 

###### Scope

The site is structured to easily navigate the world of art as well as find particular subject one searches for.

###### Structure

The site structure is based on ergonomics, so it is to take the customer to the information 
one’s searching without having to scroll through any unnecessary documents, 
reading texts that are advertising or filing the forms that appear to be unnecessary. 

###### Sceleton

Using these wireframes were created to support the idea of a site.

###### Surface

The colour palette was chosen on Pinterest platform to benefit a simple design of the project.

###### Technologies

HTML – to create the foundation of a site.
CSS – to create visually pleasant web page.
JavaScript – to make it more interactive.
MongoDB – for data 
Python 
Materialize – to make it responsive.
Axure – to create sketches of a future site.
JQuery - to simplify DOM manipulation

###### Features

The existing features let the user to register on the site and use the features that other users can only read.
1. User that does not want to register can read the ideas, but thats all, 
2. User register and can use features that let them add categories or ideas or edit them or remove them.

###### Features left to implement

The features that can be added in a future are: 
1. The possibility of a private messages between members, 
2. The possibility to upload sketches or images, 
3. The possibility to upload examples of used ideas, 
4. The possibility to rate the ideas.

###### Testing

Welcome Laura Kubiliene,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

--------

Happy coding!
